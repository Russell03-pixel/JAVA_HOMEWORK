# Homework Correction and Feedback 

## Task Overview
This repository contains a Java program submitted by Russel as part of his homework assignment. The program covers basic concepts such as string manipulation, arrays, loops, and character operations. Below are the corrections, feedback, and improvements for the provided code.

## Corrections:

### 1. **Method Name Case-Sensitive Error**
   - **Error:** In the line `System.out.println(city.toUppercase());`, the method name should be `toUpperCase()` instead of `toUppercase()`.
   - **Fix:** Change the line to:
   
   ```java
   System.out.println(city.toUpperCase());
 ```

# 2. **Inappropriate Variable Name**
- **Error:** The variable favfood = "pussy"; is inappropriate and unprofessional. Variable names should be meaningful and respectful.

- **Fix:** Change the variable value to something more appropriate, such as "Pizza" or "Sushi".

```java

String favfood = "Pizza";
```
# 3. **Typo in Array Declaration**
- **Error:** The array declaration contains a typo in the keyword Sring.
- **Fix:** Change the line to:

```java
String[] movies = {"Takers", "Deadpool", "Avengers", "Titanic"};
```
# 4. **Missing Semicolon**
- **Error:** The statement System.out.println("Print name 3 times:") is missing a semicolon at the end.
- **Fix:** Change the line to:

```java
System.out.println("Print name 3 times:");
```

# 5. **Variable count Typo**
- **Error:** In the while loop, count is not defined. The correct variable name is count.

- **Fix:** Change the line to:

```java
System.out.println(count);
```
6. Incorrect Syntax in do-while Loop
- **Error:** The statement System.out.println(countdown): in the do-while loop contains a syntax error (a colon instead of a semicolon).
- **Fix:** Change the line to:

```java
System.out.println(countdown);
```
7. Typo in else Statement
 - **Error:** The statement else if (a < b){ contains a typo, it should be else if (a < b) (missing 'e' in 'else').
- **Fix:** Change the line to:

```java
else if (a < b){
```
8. Unnecessary Closing Braces
Error: There are extra closing braces at the end of the code.

- **Fix:** Remove unnecessary braces, specifically the closing brace for public class Homework at the end.

Grading:
Overall Grade: 6/10

Feedback:

The code covers the basic concepts but there are several syntax errors, inappropriate variable names, and missing semicolons.

Ensure professionalism in variable names and comments.

Pay attention to typos in method names, variable names, and syntax.

Keep an eye on correct syntax for control flow statements (if, else, for, etc.) and remember to close your statements with semicolons.

Good effort, but be sure to double-check your syntax next time!

I will provide a marked java file named MarkedHomework.java.
